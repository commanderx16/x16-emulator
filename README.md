# Commander X16 Emulator

This is an emulator for the Commander X16 computer system. It only depends on SDL2 and should compile on all modern operating systems.

## Starting

You can start `x16emu`/`x16emu.exe` either by double-clicking it, or from the command line. The latter allows you to specify additional arguments.

* When starting `x16emu` without arguments, it will pick up the system ROM (`rom.bin`) and the character ROM (`chargen.bin`) from the executable's directory.
* The system ROM and character ROM filenames/paths can be overridden with the `-rom` and `-char` command line arguments.
* `-sdcard` lets you specify an SD card image (partition table + FAT32).
* `-prg` lets you specify a `.prg` file that gets injected into RAM after start.
* `-run` same as above, but also executes the application using `RUN` or `SYS`, depending on the load address.
* `-bas` lets you specify a BASIC program in ASCII format that automatically typed in (and tokenized).
* `-echo` causes all KERNAL/BASIC output to be printed to the host's terminal. Enable this and use the BASIC command "LIST" to convert a BASIC program to ASCII (detokenize).
* `-debug` enables the debugger.
* When compiled with `#define TRACE`, `-trace` will enable an instruction trace on stdout.

Run `x16emu -h` to see all command line options.

## Functions while running

* Ctrl + R will reset the computer.
* Ctrl + V will paste the clipboard by injecting key presses.
* Ctrl + S will save a memory dump (40 KB main RAM + 2 MB bankable RAM) to disk.
* Ctrl + Return will toggle full screen mode.

On the Mac, use the Cmd key instead.

## Host Filesystem Interface

If the system ROM contains any version of the KERNAL, the LOAD (`$FFD5`) and SAVE (`$FFD8`) KERNAL calls are intercepted by the emulator if the device is 1 (which is the default). So the BASIC statements

      LOAD"$
      LOAD"FOO.PRG
      LOAD"IMAGE.PRG",1,1
      SAVE"BAR.PRG

will target the host computer's local filesystem.

## Dealing with BASIC Programs

BASIC programs are encoded in a tokenized form, they are not simply ASCII files. If you want to edit BASIC programs on the host's text editor, you need to convert it between tokenized BASIC form and ASCII.

* To convert ASCII to BASIC, reboot the machine and paste the ASCII text using Ctrl + V (Mac: Cmd + V). You can now run the program, or use the `SAVE` BASIC command to write the tokenized version to disk.
* To convert BASIC to ASCII, start x16emu with the -echo argument, `LOAD` the BASIC file, and type `LIST`. Now copy the ASCII version from the terminal.

## Using the KERNAL/BASIC environment

Please see the KERNAL/BASIC documentation.

## Debugger 

The debugger requires -debug to start. Without it it is effectively disabled. 

There are 2 panels you can control. The code panel, the top left half, and the data panel, the bottom half of the screen. The displayed address can be changed using keys 0-9 and A-F, in a 'shift and roll' manner (easier to see than explain). To change the data panel address, press the shift key and type 0-9 A-F. The top write panel is fixed.

The debugger keys are similar to the Microsoft Debugger shortcut keys, and work as follows

F1 		resets the shown code position to the current PC
F2 		resets the 65C02 CPU but not any of the hardware.
F5 		is used to return to Run mode, the emulator should run as normal.
F9 		sets the breakpoint to the currently code position.
F10 	steps 'over' routines - if the next instruction is JSR it will break on return.
F11 	steps 'into' routines.
F12 	is used to break back into the debugger. This does not happen if you do not have -debug

Effectively keyboard routines only work when the debugger is running normally. Single stepping through keyboard code will not work at present.

## Release Notes

### Release 28

* support for 65C02 opcodes [Paul Robson]
* keep aspect ratio when resizing window [Sebastian Voges]
* updated sprite logic to VERA 0.7 – **the layout of the sprite data registers has changed, you need to change your code!**


### Release 27

* Command line overhaul. Supports `-rom`, `-char`, `-sdcard` and `-prg`.
* ROM and char filename defaults, so x16emu can be started without arguments.
* Host Filesystem Interface supports LOAD"$"
* macOS and Windows packaging logic in Makefile

### Release 26

* better sprite support (clipping, palette offset, flipping)
* better border support
* KERNAL can set up interlaced NTSC mode with scaling and borders (compile time option)

### Release 25

* sdcard: fixed LOAD,x,1 to load to the correct addressg
* sdcard: all temp data will be on bank #255; current bank will remain unchanged
* DOS: support for DOS commands ("UI", "I", "V", ...) and more status messages (e.g. 26,WRITE PROTECT ON,00,00)
* BASIC: "DOS" command. Without argument: print disk status; with "$" argument: show directory; with "8" or "9" argument: switch default drive; otherwise: send DOS command; also accessible through F7/F8
* Vera: cycle exact rendering, NTSC, interlacing, border

### Release 24

* SD card support
	* pass path to SD card image as third argument
	* access SD card as drive 8
	* the local PC/Mac disk is still drive 1
	* modulo debugging, this would work on a real X16 with the SD card (plus level shifters) hooked up to VIA#2PB as described in sdcard.c in the emulator surce

### Release 23

* Updated emulator and ROM to spec 0.6 – the ROM image should work on a real X16 with VERA 0.6 now.

### Release 22

SYS65375 (SWAPPER) now also clears the screen, avoid ing side effects.

### Release 21

* support for $ and % number prefixes in BASIC
* support for C128 KERNAL APIs LKUPLA, LKUPSA and CLOSE_ALL

### Release 20

* Toggle fullscreen using Cmd+F or Cmd+return

rom.bin is now 3*8 KB:
	* 0: BASIC (bank 0 at $C000)
	* 1: KERNAL ($E000)
	* 2: UTIL (bank 1 at $C000)

### Release 15

### Release 12

* Supports 8bpp tile mode (mode 4)

### Release 11

* The emulator and the KERNAL now speak the bit-level PS/2 protocol over VIA#2 PA0/PA1. The system behaves the same, but keyboard input in the ROM should work on a real device. 

### Release 10

updated KERNAL with proper power-on message

### Release 9

* LOAD and SAVE commands are intercepted by the emulator, can be used to access local file system, like this:

      LOAD"TETRIS.PRG
      SAVE"TETRIS.PRG

* No device number is necessary. Loading absolute works like this:

      LOAD"FILE.PRG",1,1

### Release 8

* New optional override load address for PRG files:

      ./x64emu rom.bin chargen.bin basic.prg,0401

### Release 7

* Now with banking. POKE40801,n to switch the RAM bank at $A000. POKE40800,n to switch the ROM bank at $C000. The ROM file at the command line can be up to 72 KB now (layout: 0: bank 0, 1: KERNAL, 2: bank 1, 3: bank 2 etc.), and the RAM that Cmd+S saves is 2088KB ($0000-$9F00: regular RAM, $9F00-$9FFF: unused, $A000+: extra banks)

### Release 5

* BASIC now starts at $0401 (39679 BASIC BYTES FREE)

### Release 4

* Cmd+S now saves all of memory (linear 64 KB for now, including ROM) to "memory.bin", "memory-1.bin", "memory-2.bin", etc. You can extract parts of it with Unix "dd", like: dd if=memory.bin of=basic.bin bs=1 skip=2049 count=38655

### Release 3

* Supports PRG file as third argument, which is injected after "READY.", so BASIC programs work as well.

### Release 2

* STOP key support

### Release 1

* 6502 core, fake PS/2 keyboard emulation (PS/2 data bytes appear at VIA#1 PB) and text mode Vera emulation
* KERNAL/BASIC modified for memory layout, missing VIC, Vera text mode and PS/2 keyboard
